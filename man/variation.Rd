\usage{
variation(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}
}
\value{
The coefficient of variation.
}
\description{
Compute the absolute \bold{coefficient of variation} \bold{cv} as proposed by Karl Pearson, which is given by the division of standard deviation by the mean. The CV reflects a normalized measure of the dispersion of a given probability distribution. Conversely, distributions with \deqn{cv < 1} are considered \dQuote{low-variance}, while those with \deqn{cv > 1} \dQuote{high-variance}.
}
\details{
\code{sd(x)/mean(x) = cv}, which is the inverse of signal-to-noise ratio.
