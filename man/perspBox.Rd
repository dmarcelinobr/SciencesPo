\title{Create an Empty Persp Plot

Creates an empty persp plot objtect

Regression demonstrations require a blank slate in which
points and planes can be drawn. This function creates that
blank persp canvas for those projects. It is not necessary
that x1, x2 and y be vectors of the same length, since this
function's only purpose is to plot an empty box with ranges
determined by the input variables. persp calls the 3 axes
x, y, and z, but here they are called x1, x2, and y.}
\usage{
perspBox(x1, x2, y, x1lab = "x1", x2lab = "x2", ylab = "y", x1lim, x2lim,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{data for the first horizontal axis, an R vector}

\item{x2}{data for the second horizontal axis, an R vector}

\item{y}{data for the vertical axis, an R vector}

\item{x1lab}{label for the x1 axis, (the one called "xlab" inside persp)}

\item{x2lab}{label for the x2 axis, (the one called "ylab" inside persp)}

\item{ylab}{label for the y (vertical) axis (the one called "zlab" inside persp)}

\item{x1lim}{Optional: limits for x1 axis (should be a vector with 2 elements)}

\item{x2lim}{Optional: limits for x2 axis (should be a vector with 2 elements)}

\item{...}{further arguments that are passed to persp. Please note
Please remember that y is the vertical axis, but for persp, that
is the one I call x2.  Thus dot-dot-dot arguments including xlab,
ylab, zlab, xlim, ylim, and zlim are going to be ignored.}

\value{
The perspective matrix that is returned by persp
