\title{Standardized Beta Coefficients}
\usage{
standardize(mod, stdev = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A linear object model}

\item{stdev}{A numeric value for standard deviation, default is 1}
}
\value{
Standardized coefficients
}
\description{
Generate standardized beta coefficients from lm model object. Standardized coefficients refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable. See details.
}
\details{
Standardized beta coefficients are values estimated from unstandardized coefficients, which are only partially adjusted by the quotient of the standard deviation of an independent variable, and the standard deviation of a dependent variable. Essentially, beta coefficients report the relative importance of each independent variables. Then, this standardization is rather useful for multiple regression models, once it may aid on identifying critical IV.

\examples{
df <- read.csv("http://www.math.smith.edu/r/data/help.csv") #get some data

female <- subset(df, female==1)

# fit a linear regression (OLS) model.

(model <- lm(pcs ~ mcs + homeless, data=female) )

# finally, apply standardization to the coefficients.

standardize(model)

# Possible interpretation: a change in 1 standard deviation of mcs has more than
# twice the impact on pcs than a 1 standard deviation change in the homeless variable.
# This example points up another potential weakness of standardized regression
# coefficients, however, in that the homeless variable can take on values of
# 0 or 1, and a 1 standard deviation change is hard to interpret.
