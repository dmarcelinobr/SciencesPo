\title{Create Block-randomized Designs}
\usage{
rand.block(blocksize, n, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{blocksize}{is the number of control blocks or n per block/group.}

\item{n}{is the total numer of subjects or units.}

\item{seed}{the random number generation seed.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item id is the id of subject or unit.
\item block is blocking factor.
\item rand is the
\item condition is the treatment levels
}
}
\description{
Generate block-randimized designs based on the number of units \code{n} and block size, where the block size is the number of experimental conditions. The number of Independent Variables and the number of levels in each IV are specified as input. The output is a the block randomized design. This function is intended for planning randomized trails.

(blk<- rand.block(blocksize=20, n=80, seed=51) )

# table(blk$block, blk$condition)
# let's do some immaginary analysis
set.seed(51);
blk$y <- rnorm(n=80, mean=20, sd=5)

# Let's look at some descriptives:
tapply(blk$y, list(blk$condition, blk$block), mean)
tapply(blk$y, list(blk$condition, blk$block), sd)

# Do the ANOVA and Make Some Graphs
# This formula that describes the response `y` by both the treatment factor (condition) and the block control (block).
# Note that aov() treats block as a **random** error component of variance, while lm() treats block as a **fixed effect**.

fit.aov <- aov(y ~ factor(condition) + factor(block), data=blk)
summary(fit.aov) # display Type I ANOVA table
drop1(fit.aov,~.,test="F") # type III SS and F Tests

# Since the p-value of 0.254 is much greater than the .05 significance level, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the mean of `y` for each  treatment conditions are all equal.

model.tables(fit.aov,"means", se=TRUE) # SE for differences, **NOT** for means
# Calculate the pooled standard error of the means.
pooled.se = sqrt(1688.1/4)

block <- c(1,2,3,4) # the values of the x axis
outcome <- c(19.76, 20.03, 18.44, 18.16) # the results from the means output
plot(block,outcome,type="b", ylab="outcome",xlab="blocks of experimental conditions",ylim=c(0,30))

fit.lm <- lm(y ~ factor(condition) + factor(block), data=blk)
