\title{Standardized Beta Coefficients}
\usage{
\method{scale}{lm}(x, std.dev = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a model object.}

\item{std.dev}{an integer value for the standard deviation, default is \code{std.dev = 1}.}
}
\value{
Standardized coefficients
}
\description{
Calculates standardized beta coefficients from \code{lm} or \code{glm} class model objects. Standardized coefficients refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable. See details.
}
\details{
Standardized beta coefficients are values estimated from unstandardized coefficients, which are only partially adjusted by the quotient of the standard deviation of the independent variable (IV), and the standard deviation of the dependent variable. Essentially, \bold{beta coefficients report the relative importance of each independent variables}. Therefore, standardized coefficients are rather important for multiple regression models, once they may aid on identifying critical IVs.

\examples{
df <- read.csv("http://www.math.smith.edu/r/data/help.csv") #get some data
female <- subset(df, female==1)

# fit a linear regression (OLS) model.
(model <- lm(pcs ~ mcs + homeless, data=female) )

# finally, apply standardization to the coefficients.
scale(model)

# Possible interpretation: a change in 1 standard deviation  of mcs has more than
# twice the impact on pcs than a 1 standard deviation change in the homeless variable.
# Despite  standardized coefficients improve transparency about the size of the effects,
# this example points to a potential weakness of standardized regression coefficients
# in that the homeless variable can take on values of either 0 or 1, and a 1 standard deviation
# change is hard to interpret in such contexts.
# Andrew Gelman makes a compelling argument for standardizing variables by 2 standard deviations
# so that the variance is similar to a binary variable (provided p is not too far from 0.5).
