\title{Compute the Skewness}
\usage{
skewness(x, na.rm = TRUE, type = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector containing the values whose skewness is to be computed.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value for \code{na.rm}, default is \code{na.rm=TRUE}.}

\item{type}{an integer between 1 and 3 selecting one of the algorithms for computing skewness detailed below.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{x}
}
\description{
The function provides three features to perform a skewness test, see details below.
}
\details{
The skewness is a measure of symmetry distribution. Intuitively, negative skewness (g_1 < 0) indicates that the mean of the data distribution is less than the median, and the data distribution is left-skewed. Positive skewness (g_1 > 0) indicates that the mean of the data values is larger than the median, and the data distribution is right-skewed. Values of g_1 near zero indicate a symmetric distribution. The skewness function will ignore missing values in \sQuote{x} for its computation purpose. There are several methods to compute skewness, Joanes and Gill (1998) discuss three of the most traditional methods. According to them, \bold{type 3} performs better in non-normal population distribution, whereas in normal-like population distribution type 2 fits better the data. Such difference between the two formulae tend to disappear in large samples.
 \bold{Type 1:} g_1 = m_3/m_2^(3/2).

\bold{Type 2:} G_1 = g_1*sqrt(n(n-1))/(n-2).

\bold{Type 3:} b_1 = m_3/s^3 = g_1 ((n-1)/n)^(3/2).
